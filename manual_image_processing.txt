Optional:
For mp4 movies, need libav, latest releases are here https://libav.org/download/
or just use unzip libav-x86_64-w64-mingw32-20180108.7z from Z:\_install\Python scripts Martin\Image_analysis to your drive and remember the path, 
it needs to be edited in LV200_crop_pad_cosmic_rays_v2.py script

Necessary:
If you do not have it already, install miniconda3 from here: 

https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html
Choose Python 3.8 Windows 64bit installer of Miniconda3, download, run the file, select admin, for all, select add to PATH, do not make default (unless you have no previous Python environment)

Create image environment and install necessary packages:

click in Windows on Start menu, run Anaconda PowerShell prompt (as admin if possible), type and enter each row and wait for installation:
conda create -n image
conda activate image
conda env list   		
conda install numpy
conda install scikit-image                          
conda install scipy

# If you have trouble installing from default channel (i.e. you get some error message), type this instead: 
conda install --channel conda-forge NAME-OF-THE-PACKAGE


# to run in IDLE, type this in conda prompt
conda activate image
idle


# to use batch file that autoactivates image env and starts idle/spyder, right click on desktop, create New text document (not Word, notepad txt),
# rename it to conda_image.bat, open it in notepad and copy paste this:

@echo on
call C:\ProgramData\Miniconda3\Scripts\activate.bat
call activate image
call python -m idlelib

# C:\ProgramData\... need to be modified to your actual path to miniconda, which depends on admin/user install!

AFTER it is installed, copy these scripts from here
Z:\_install\Python scripts Martin\Image_analysis
LV200_crop_pad_cosmic_rays.py
LV200_rename_move_v4_automatic.py

Open them in idle and follow instructions in them.

To analyze images in ImageJ and get data from macro ROIs/cell-sized grid ROIs and then analyze them in per2py, follow _manual_per2py_lumicycle.txt. 
To use cell tracking in ImageJ TrackMate and analyze in per2py, follow manual_ImageJ and Trackmate v1.txt and _manual_per2py_trackmate.txt
